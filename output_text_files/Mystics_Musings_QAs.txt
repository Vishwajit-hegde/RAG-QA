Q: What is the significance of Sadhguru's response to the seeker's predicament, "You cannot choose a Guru. Deepen your longing and the Guru will choose you"?
A: Sadhguru's response highlights the importance of fostering inner longing and receptivity to the spiritual process, rather than seeking a Guru through external means. It emphasizes that the Guru-disciple relationship is not a matter of personal choice, but rather a mystical connection that unfolds when the disciple is ready. This approach undermines the traditional notion of seeking a Guru and emphasizes the significance of self-transcendence and inner transformation.

If you think he is someone who walks on water, who  materializes things out of thin air, reads people's minds, looks into a crystal ball and  tells people what they did and what they ought to do, you are in for a surprise. And if  you think not, you are in for a bigger surprise!    For those of us who have had the good fortune of being a witness to all the  contradictions, paradoxes, compassion and Grace--sparks and thunders apart---from a  million other things that he is, attempting to describe him is certainly not an enviable  task. Yet, the possibilities and promises for the nonprofessional and the world, in this  most blessed phenomenon of our time are so rich and plenty that it would indeed be  criminal to not make an attempt, however clumsy.    I first met Sadhguru sixteen years ago, when I had just finished my schooling and was  in college. A particular teacher in my school had enthralled us to seek a spiritual  master—actually the more sacred version of it--a Guru--and be initiated by him, like he  himself was. My imagination, fired by books like The Autobiography of a Yogi and  other similar works led me to yearn for a similar esoteric opportunity. For a couple of  years, the picture of a sagely being with a long, flowing, grey beard sitting under a  banyan tree and teleporting a handful of disciples into the other worlds was deeply  imprinted in me.    So, when I first met this clean shaven, blue jeans and T shirt clad man speaking  flawless English and riding a motorcycle, as Sadhguru was in those days, I did not in  the least think that I had met the Guru. However, the forty minutes that I spent in his  introductory talk temporarily distracted me from the sage under the tree and made me  look forward to his teachings and practices with the hope that it would help my near  sightedness and my studies--my most pressing problems then.    As years passed, and I got to spend a little more time with this person, unknown to me,  bit by bit, little things in me began to align and orient themselves to seek the higher  realms of knowing and living and to not settle for the mundane and the mediocre. Ever  since then, in scarcely detectable ways, undeterred by my own un-doings, Sadhguru's  Grace and unseen hands continue to transform my life, taking me beyond my  limitations to a destination unknown and undreamt of.    To find a real Guru, a true Guru, or the best Guru, is the most common Quest of the  seeker. Especially in this culture, where the spectrum of spirituality spans from the  devout to the atheist, from the pious to the Aghoras-the gory and the unsightly, from  the ascetic to the emperor, from the selfless, industrious karma yogis to the academic  Vedantins; obviously, getting one's prescription right is of paramount importance.    Sadhguru’s response to the predicament has been, "You cannot choose a Guru. Deepen  your longing and the Guru will choose you,” a reality from his own life.    Sadhguru's ways are very unorthodox, if not wild; totally devoid of conformity and  other tell tale marks of one who has been through the Garadi [A Traditional School of Physical    Culture. The Ever watchful guru of the garadi carefully moulds the character of the disciple before imparting the training that will    empower him with untold physical powers]  of a Guru. So it was only natural to assume that Sadhguru  evolved by himself, an example that one wished to emulate. Sadhguru takes utmost        -----      3    care as to how he deals with each person he encounters. Somewhat like the famous  saint who threw a volley of stones at the visitors to his ashram taking care that not one  stone ever hit anybody, Sadhguru’s abrasive ways have always fostered growth. Yet  being with such a person meant there was no knowing what could happen next. This  always kept us on tenterhooks.

Q: What is the theme of the poem written by Sadhguru, as described in the passage?
A: The theme of the poem written by Sadhguru is the seeker's predicament, which is described as being trapped in layers of ignorance that bind more tightly than any cement or concrete, and the pain of not knowing where one comes from or where one is bound.
Context: So one morning, at a Sathsang in the ashram when Sadhguru spoke for the first time  about his Guru who graced him three lifetimes ago and the Dhyanalinga, the reactions  were mixed. For many, it was reaffirmation of their secret belief and wish of Sadhguru  being connected to a sacred and ancient lineage of Masters, but for clumsy novices like  me who were bumped and bounced often on this roller coaster ride with him, it was  like an insurance policy. "Despite his wild ways," I distinctly remember thinking, "this  man is actually accountable..."    Of all the wonderful traits of Sadhguru, the one that endears him to one and all is that  of being a friend. As one who abhors the seriousness that people on the spiritual path  often get into, Sadhguru often imparts the most profound teaching with utmost  nonchalance. His uncanny sense of humour not only delivers the message, but also  gives the seeker the much needed break from the monotony that often sets in.    To a disciple who lamented in a poem that he sought to become an eagle in the sky, but  only managed to become a hen looking up to the eagle, pat came the reply:    'The hen that you are, how will you know what deceptive ways Grace will descend?”    “It is Grace that brought you here and it is Grace that will deliver”    “I prefer the hen that looks up to the sky than an eagle that flies but always looking  down.”    “How high is not the Question, but how intense is your longing for the sky.”    May you always be in Grace!”      -Sadhguru    To print in the form of a book the Master's words about the sacred, spoken to careful  prepared disciples and to make it available to the uninitiated and the indifferent alike is  definitely a sacrilege at Isha, where 'live transmission of the experience' is the mantra.    However, this book is not to create another mirage in the harsh deserts of life, but to  spread the sacred fragrance of bounty and abundance of the presence of an Oasis of a  Living Master and an invitation for one and all to come, drink, dive and dissolve into it.  Those of us, who have been blessed by being involved in making this book, happen bow  down in gratitude to Sadhguru for enabling us to make this priceless offering to the  world.    In the history and the lore, we have heard of many Blessed beings who strive to  enlighten the world in their own ways. Some from the solitude, of the mountains, some  from their palaces, some from their hermitages, some in the battlefields, and some in  the marketplace. Sadhguru, whose abode once was the peaks of the Velliangiri  Mountains, in a symbolism that is true of His own life and work, now has descended to  the foothills to inspire and infuse the seeking into the beings of the plains.        -----      4    At a time when we are overwhelmed by the innumerable calls all around by leaders of  sorts exhorting the masses to follow them, these verses from a poem by Sadhguru  summarize what is typical of Him:    …I was born like you, I eat like you,  Sleep like you and I will die like you,  But the limited has not limited me,  Life’s bondages have not bound me,  As the dance of life progresses,  This space this un-bounded-ness has become  Unbearably sweet,    Become love and reach out  Become Me!  ---- Swami Nisarga    _Note to the Reader:_     This work is a collection of the words of wisdom of the Master spoken to close disciples  over a period of ten years at various occasions and settings. Covering the topics that he  seldom addresses otherwise in the public, these words were spoken to foster the growth  of those few who had the good fortune of being with him for a long time.    To the casual reader, it can shock, provoke, amuse, intrigue and entertain, but when  approached with the openness and innocence of the one who seeks, it can start a  powerful process within--a journey and a pilgrimage into the very core of Existence. In  an effort to reproduce the words of the Master in their original form, words and  expressions from Sanskrit and other Indian languages used extensively by the master  are retained as such and described in the glossary at the end of the book.    Short poems by Sadhguru adorn each chapter of the book and Swami Nisarga writes  the brief introductions that follow, as well as the afterword. In presenting this priceless  work we hope you will be able to be one with the Master and His Grace.    Namasthe.    _Chapter-1_    _Seeker’s Predicament_    From muses and mystics you did hear  Seeming to be the sounds of phantom lands    In ignorance’s bind, life-like phantom seems  Oh, creatures of surface, the depths of life will you ever seek.            ----Sadhguru        -----      5              -----      6          Knowing not where he comes from, knowing not where he is bound, and the seeker's  predicament are indeed pathetic. Trapped in layers of ignorance that bind more tightly  than any cement or concrete, the seeker's pain is known only to those who have lived it.

Q: What is the reason behind fear and insecurity according to Sadhguru?
A: According to Sadhguru, fear and insecurity arise from an overactive and out-of-control mind, and the fundamental reason for it is the limited experience of life as a physical being. As long as one is identified with the physical body and mental faculties, fear and insecurity are inevitable.
Context: Starting his journey from an obscure point in evolution, where life chooses to bestow  awareness and conscious seeking in him, the seeker is confronted with a plethora of  choices and uncertainties on the path. Without proper guidance and the necessary  Grace, like a rudderless boat, the seeker goes in endless circles in a boundless ocean,  alternately chasing some glimmer of light on the horizon and plugging those self-  destructive leaks one's ignorance keeps punching into oneself.    Like a solitary shepherd in the mountains, lovingly resting his flock under the moonlit  skies between two hard days of a long journey whose course and outcome are known  only to him, these interactions with the Master reflect a rare kind of intimacy,  understanding and compassion that springs from the Master's deep urge to share and  deliver.    He knows that the kindness, the insights and the wisdom, which he so generously  shares, soothe the bruises and the wounds of the day and firm up the resolve of the  flock to walk with him one more day. Thus, day after day, the Master charms his flock,  infusing an ethereal lightness into those he can while numbing the pain and biding his  time with those he cannot.        -----      7    **Seeker: Sadhguru, as I walk this path I am becoming aware of the many**  **fears and insecurities I have within me. How do I leave these behind and**  **move ahead?**    **Sadhguru:** You don't have to leave your fears and insecurities because they don't  really exist. You keep creating them unconsciously. If you don't create them, they don't  really exist. Why you create them and how to stop creating them, that's your question.  The fundamental reason why fear has arisen in you is one way of looking at it is--in this  vast existence of which you don't know the beginning or the end you're just a little  human being. Being the small entity that you are right now, naturally fear is there. It's  overwhelming; there is fear and insecurity about what will happen to you.    As long as you're identified as a physical body, as long as your experience of life is  limited to your physical and mental faculties, fear and insecurity are inevitable. It's just  that different people may be at different levels of fear and insecurity. Today, if your life  is happening well, you might have forgotten your insecurity. Tomorrow, if your life is  turned upside down, you will be reminded because it's always within you. Only when a  person begins to experience himself beyond the limitations of his physical body and  mind, then this person can become free from insecurity and fear.    Experiencing yourself beyond the physical is what we're referring to as spiritual. When  I say spiritual, don't think it is about going to a temple. Don't think it is about praying  for this or that. If you look at your prayers, ninety-five per cent of the prayers in the  world are all about either asking for something, fundamentally asking for protection, or  for being taken care of. There's nothing spiritual about it; it is plain basic survival. In  most people, the very basis of prayer is fear and insecurity. If prayer exists in your life  as an act only, it is obscene, being reverential towards one aspect and not being so to  everything else. If you become prayerful, that's wonderful, and if you're using an act of  prayer towards becoming that quality, that's fine. Now if you're routing your survival  through the heavens, that's very stupid: even worms and insects take care of their own  survival. So when I say 'spiritual’, I am talking about you beginning to experience that  which is not physical. Once this spiritual dimension is alive once you start experiencing  yourself beyond the limitations of the physical and the mental, only then there's no  such thing as fear. Fear is just the creation of an overactive and out-of control-mind.    **Seeker: But Sadhguru isn't it very natural and human to become anxious**  **when things don't go the way we expect them to?**    **Sadhguru:** Why are you making all your in-capabilities natural and human? Now if a  few things are not going smoothly in my life and if I do not become anxious about  them, if I retain my sense of balance and continue to do what I have to do, would you  call me inhuman? Is that what you're saying? When things aren't going the way you  want them to go, that's when your capability is most needed. When you become  anxious do you become more capable or less capable? Less capable, isn't it? When you  most need your capability, you're forsaking it; would you call that an intelligent way to  act? So what you're saying is to live unintelligently is human; that's a very wrong idea.  To live intelligently is what being human is all about!    **Seeker: Much of the anxiety I experience comes through my relationships.**  **Isn't it reasonable to expect some understanding from other people?**        -----      8

Q: What is the importance of understanding in relationships, according to Sadhguru?
A: According to Sadhguru, understanding is crucial in relationships, as it allows us to embrace the limitations and capabilities of others, create situations where they can understand us better, and make the relationship the way we want it. If we don't understand their madness, we will lose them. Therefore, it's important to enhance our understanding to such a point that we can look beyond people's madness also.
Context: **Sadhguru:** When you live in this world, there are various types of complex  interactions happening. As your field of play increases, the complexity of interaction  also goes on increasing. If you're just sitting in a cubicle, working on your computer  with only one other person, you need only a little understanding; but if you're  managing a thousand people, you need a vast understanding of everybody. Now  suppose you're managing a thousand people and you want all these people to  understand you, then you're not going to manage anything. You need to understand the  limitations and the capabilities of these thousand people and do what you can; only  then will you have the power to move the situation the way you want it to go. If you're  waiting for these thousand people to understand you and act, it is only a pipe dream;  it's never going to happen.        **Seeker: Suppose somebody is in a close relationship with me and is very**  **important to me. Shouldn't I expect better understanding from them?**    **Sadhguru:** That's the point; the closer the relationship is, the more effort you should  make to understand them, but that's not what's happening in your case, Ram. It so  happened, once there was a man who had been slipping in and out of a coma for several  months, with his wife staying at his bedside night and day. When he came to, in those  few moments of consciousness, he motioned for her to come closer. As she sat beside  him, he said, "I've been thinking ... you have been with me through all the bad times in  my life. When I got fired, you were there to support me. When my business went down  the tubes, you were there working overtime and doing night shifts. When I got shot you  were by my side. When we lost the house in that legal clash, you were right there beside  me. Now my health is failing, and you're still by my side. Now when I consider all this, I  think you only bring me bad luck". This is exactly what you're doing to yourself and to  your relationships. Somebody becomes closer and dearer to you only as you understand  them better. If they understand you, they enjoy the closeness of the relationship. If you  understand them better, then you enjoy the closeness.            -----      9          **Seeker: This is easier said than done. It is difficult to always be there...**    **Sadhguru:** See, It's not that the other person is totally bereft of understanding. With  your understanding, you can create situations where the other person would be able to  understand you better. If you're expecting the other to understand and comply with  you all the time while you don't understand the limitations, the possibilities, the needs  and the capabilities of that person, then conflict is all that will happen; it is bound to  happen. Unfortunately, the closest relationships in the world have more conflict going  on than there is between India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan have fought only three  battles. In your relationships, you have fought many more battles than this and are still  fighting, isn't it so? This is because your line of understanding and theirs is different. If  you cross this L. O. C; this line of control, they will get mad. If they cross it, you will get  mad. If you move your understanding beyond theirs, their understanding also becomes  a part of your understanding. You will be able to embrace their limitations and  capabilities. In everyone, there are some positive things and some negative things. If  you embrace all this in your understanding, you can make the relationship the way you  want it. If you leave it to their understanding, it will become accidental. If they are very  magnanimous, things will happen well for you; if not, the relationship will break up.    All I am asking is: do you want to be the one who decides what happens to your life?  Whether they are close relationships, professional, political, global or whatever, don't  you want to be the person who decides what happens in your life? If you do, you better  include everything and everybody into your understanding. You should enhance your  understanding to such a point that you can look beyond people's madness also. There  are very wonderful people around you, but occasionally they like to go crazy for a few  minutes. If you don't understand that, you will lose them. If you don't understand their  madness, you will definitely lose them. If you do, then you know how to handle them.  Life is not always a straight line; you have to do many things to keep it going. If you  forsake your understanding, your capability will be lost. Whether it's a question of  personal relationships or professional management, in both places you need  understanding; otherwise, you won't have fruitful relationships.

Q: What is the best way to approach a business deal, according to Sadhguru?
A: According to Sadhguru, the best way to approach a business deal is to fall in love with the whole situation and be unconditionally involved in it, rather than trying to make a deal and get the best outcome for oneself. One should offer oneself to the situation and do the best they can, without worrying about always pulling off deals.
Context: **Seeker: Talking specifically about the work situation, there's a company we**  **have been approaching for business and they're taking their own sweet**  **time in letting us know if we've got the deal. It is extremely frustrating and**  **de-motivating. I'm tempted to just curse the client and move on. Now if our**  **understanding encompasses the client's difficulties, we may be more at**        -----      10    **peace, but wouldn't that dull the edge we need to pursue and close the**  **deal?**    **Sadhguru:** If you really want the best deals in life, don't try to make deals. You must  be in such a way that your client should fall in love with you in every way. This is not a  trick. The deal will happen if it's necessary; it won't happen if it's not. The deal is for  both people's well being, so it must be needed by both of you. Once we live in the world,  there are transactions. Some are of a personal nature, others are different. All of them  affect your life. Whether you talk to a taxi driver for a minute, or you talk to your boss,  or speak to your client, husband, wife or child; every transaction is affecting your life.  Now the problem with you is that you hold one transaction above the other. You  involve yourself more with one and less with the other. It won't work like that. All these  things are needed for you to have a fruitful life. Why don't you just fall in love with the  whole situation? As long as you wish to be in that situation, make it happen like a huge  love affair. Why not? That's how it should be. Only then work becomes effortless. What  is it you're calling a love affair? It's unconditional involvement and doing whatever is  needed. If you don't have that sense of involvement, you will always try to get the best  deal out of somebody. That means you must meet the dumbest people in the world.  Intelligent people will never bite your dumb deals. There once was this almost  confirmed bachelor who for months had been pursuing an attractive lady and became  her most devoted admirer. Finally, he collected sufficient courage to ask her the most  momentous of all questions. "There are quite a lot of advantages to being a bachelor,"  he began, "but there comes a time when one longs for the companionship of another  being. A being who will regard one as perfect, as an idol to be worshiped and treated as  one's absolute own, who will be kind and faithful when times are tough and hard, who  will share one's joys and sorrows.” To his delight, he saw a sympathetic gleam in her  eyes. She nodded in agreement and then said, “I think it's a great idea! Can I help you  choose which puppy to buy?"    So do you see that for you to make a deal, you should only meet people who are more  stupid than you. If you meet people who are more intelligent than you, there's no way  to get the deal to your advantage. If you just give yourself and see how both of you can  be benefitted from the deal, then whenever it is possible, it will happen. Of course,  deals are subject to many other conditions such as market situations, economic  conditions or the world situation, but if you establish your inner way of being and are  doing the best you can do, then what has to happen, according to your capability, will  happen. What you can't do won't happen anyway. Even if you break your head it won't  happen, but that's okay. You need not be a super human being capable of doing  everything. If you don't do what you're capable of doing, that's when it's not okay, that's  when you have failed. So don't worry about always pulling off deals, deals and more  deals. Just learn to offer yourself, which is the best possible thing that you can offer to  the whole situation. Then naturally, people will take it if it's what they need. God didn't  intend this. You have become a disciple of the devil if your whole life is about making  deals. The devil is always making a deal with somebody. God never made a deal with  anybody. Once it so happened, that a priest was walking on the street and he saw a man  who had just been stabbed. The man was lying face down on the street, struggling for  breath and writhing in pain. The priest had, always been taught that compassion was  the highest thing love is the way, and all that stuff. Naturally, he ran to the man. He  turned him over and saw that it was the devil himself. He was shocked, horrified, and        -----      11    quickly backed away. The devil begged him, "Please take me to the hospital! Do  something!" The priest
