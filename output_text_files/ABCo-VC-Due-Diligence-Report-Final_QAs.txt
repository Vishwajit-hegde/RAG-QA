Business Model    **Business Model Maturity: Rank #1 –** **Mature, proven and scalable** ****    Affiliate marketing business with cashback loyalty program is proven to be a great performance marketing tool in  established markets based on successful examples. Ebates became a successful leader in the North American (both  USA and Canada) marketplace and got acquired by Japanese e-commerce leader Rakuten for $1B. Honey, a  successful browser-extension based shopping rewards platform got acquired by Paypal for $4B. Based on publicly  available information, Ebates was profitable with positive cashflow when filed for S-1 before getting acquired.  Rakuten’s Internet Services business unit, which includes Rakuten Rewards (formerly Ebates) is [showing a profit](https://global.rakuten.com/corp/investors/assets/doc/documents/21Q2tanshin_E.pdf) for  the six months period ending in June 30, 2021. This business model has potential for a very strong customer        -----      retention when executed well and can create a network effect where merchants are more likely to deal with  affiliate marketing sites with larger userbase.    ####### 4.2.1.1.  ####### Cohort Analysis    Cohort analysis ( _Appendix-C_ ) of buyers registered between 2018 through 2021 and respective GMV spend per buyer  shows that there was a **degradation of GMV per buyer** in 2020. This degradation is attributable to COVID-19  pandemic. But further analysis shows that there is a positive trend in cohort spend through 2021.    Please note that the data provided by ABCo. is till Sep. 23, 2021. This data is projected to Q4 ’21 based on the  estimated revenue of $50B for 2021 ( _Appendix-C_ ).     _Graph-3: Cohort analyses_    GMV/Buyer for Cohorts (CIS)    $500    $396 $424    $383  $      |Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  ||||$298 $262|||||||||||||||  |||||||||||||||||||  ||||$189|||||||||||||||  |||||||||||||||||||  |||||||||||||||||||  |||||||||$131||||||||||  |||||||||||||||||||  |||||||||||||||||||  |||||||||||||||||||      $-    2018 2019 2020 2021    2018 2019 2020 2021                 GMV/Buyer for Cohorts (International)    $800    $617  $594 $544 $600    $479      |Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  |||||||||||||||||  |||||||||||||||||  ||$174|||||$192||||||||||  |||||||||||||||||  |||||||||||||||||      $-    2018 2019 2020 2021    2018 2019 2020 2021         Company is able to receive an average commission rate between 5% - 5.5% at this time. This **can be as high as 8%**   when the market is fully established, and company is able to uplift the merchant spend on affiliate marketing  channels. This is a significant opportunity for the company to grow and requires investment in sales, analytics and  industry lobbying.        -----      _Graph-4: CAC for different businesses_ __ _(Source: DemandJump, 2019)_    ###### Customer Acquisition Cost (By Industry)    Affiliate Marketing    $395    $400  $450

Q: What is the recommended strategy for ABCo. to overcome the industry inflection point and achieve sustainable growth?
A: The recommended strategy for ABCo. is to increase the sales budget to attract merchants onto the platform and establish the industry in emerging markets. This investment will involve strengthening the sales team, improved analytics capabilities, industry conferences, and regulatory lobbying. By doing so, ABCo. can create a stronger network effect and increase marketing commission rates by merchants, ultimately achieving sustainable growth.

This is relatively lower compared to  $21/ftb in established markets, but payback period matches 1year based on the information provided.    **Notes on the industry:**    Analysis of cohort spend, payback period, combined with current ecosystem of product portfolio suggests that  there is a significant opportunity to increase the LTV of an acquired customer **up through the conversion pipeline** .  This is achievable by increasing the customer engagement with an ecosystem of product offerings, personalization  & shopping discovery tools.    _Picture-1: Shopping conversion funnel_    ##### Discover    ##### Find ****    ##### Convert          ####### 4.2.1.2.  ####### Growth Plan Review    This cashback business model has a characteristic of fast growth till certain size of the market and hits an inflection  point where company has to work with merchants to increase their budget for this marketing channel. This  challenge should be mitigated early on with a combination of product strategy, sales team maturity, marketing and  industry leadership driven by specific **conferences and education** . Company should also be aware that there can  be country level regulations which may classify this business model as a possible pyramid scheme or kick-back  model and prevent further innovation in loyalty models.        -----      There are few major assumptions with respect to projected growth _(Table-3)_ :    -  Cashback loyalty market will grow to 3% of the ecommerce in the addressable market (~$1.4T)    -  ABCo. will be able to capture #1 position in these markets with 50+% of market share    -  Commission rate will remain around 5.5%    _Table-3: Growth, P&L Projections (as provided by ABCo.)_    Possible industry    inflection point        _Table-4: Growth P&L Projections (Recommended scenario in_ _$MM_ _)_      |2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 GMV $916 $2,076 $4,388 $8,379 $14,843 $22,206 Instead of focusing on purely higher-cashback driven commission % 5.5% 5.5% 5.8% 6.0% 6.3% 6.5% growth, increase the budget for product innovation & sales development so that the Net Revenue $50 $114 $252 $503 $928 $1,443 company can establish the market for higher commission margin % 43% 40% 40% 42% 35% 38% Gross Profit $22 $46 $101 $211 $325 $548 Marketing $14 $40 $76 $157 $232 $361 marketing % 28.0% 35.1% 30.0% 31.2% 25.0% 25.0% R&D $2 $9 $13 $18 $23 $29 r&d % 4.0% 8.0% 5.0% 3.5% 2.5% 2.0% SG&A $7 $13 $20 $23 $28 $36 sg&a % 14.0% 11.0% 8.0% 4.5% 3.0% 2.5% Profit (Loss) -$2 -$16 -$8 $14 $42 $123|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|Col9|Col10|Col11|Col12|Col13|Col14|Col15|Col16|Col17|Col18|Col19|Col20|Col21|  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  ||||2021|||2022|||2023|||2024|||2025|||2026|||  |GMV|||$916|||$2,076|||$4,388|||$8,379|||$14,843|||$22,206|||  |commission %|||5.5%|||5.5%|||5.8%|||6.0%|||6.3%|||6.5%|||  |Net Revenue|||$50|||$114|||$252|||$503|||$928|||$1,443|||  |margin %|||43%|||40%|||40%|||42%|||35%|||38%|||  |Gross Profit|||$22|||$46|||$101|||$211|||$325|||$548|||  |Marketing|||$14|||$40|||$76|||$157|||$232|||$361|||  |marketing %|||28.0%|||35.1%|||30.0%|||31.2%|||25.0%|||25.0%|||  |R&D|||$2|||$9|||$13|||$18|||$23|||$29|||  |r&d %|||4.0%|||8.0%|||5.0%|||3.5%|||2.5%|||2.0%|||  |SG&A|||$7|||$13|||$20|||$23|||$28|||$36|||  |sg&a %|||14.0%|||11.0%|||8.0%|||4.5%|||3.0%|||2.5%|||  ||Profit (Loss)|||-$2|||-$16|||-$8|||$14|||$42|||$123||      Based on the marketing spend plan ( _Table-3_ ), there is a good chance that the projected top-line revenue is  achievable till 2023, but there should be a proportional increase in sales related spend in order to increase  merchant commission on company’s platform to convert the acquired customer (paid through marketing). Current  growth projections are dependent on increased cashback and more marketing. This strategy will create an industry  inflection point where overall cashback loyalty market itself may start becoming flat. To overcome this, industry  leaders like ABCo. will need to invest in sales and industry establishment.    It is highly recommended that **Sales budget should be increased** to attract merchants on to platform and establish  the industry in the emerging markets. Investment like this will involve, strengthening of the sales team, improved  analytics capabilities, industry conferences and regulatory lobbying. This increased investment will be paid off  through increased marketing commission rates by merchants and stronger network effect.        -----

Q: What is the main factor that contributes to the positive trend in user engagement and increased revenue per user on the company's platform, according to the given analysis?
A: The main factor that contributes to the positive trend in user engagement and increased revenue per user on the company's platform is the increased investment in product innovation, which has led to a differentiator (moat) that makes it hard for competitors to copy, and has created additional revenue streams, resulting in an upward trend in commission percentage.
Context: Parallelly, increased product development and technology investments will create a differentiator (moat) that will  make it hard for competitors to copy. This increased investment in product innovation will lead to additional  revenue streams that create an upward trend in commission percentage.    ####### 4.2.1.3.  ####### Unit Economics of the Company    **Unit Economics Maturity: Rank #3 - Good trend so far.

Part of this may be skewed by the dip in 2020 due to COVID-19, but the improvement of 17% quarter  over quarter with 28% improvement between Q1 to Q2 of 2021 shows an increased engagement of the customers  on the platform and is a very healthy trend for the company. It is hard to establish ideal number for the business  metric ‘Revenue/User’ as it continuously changes based on the macro economic conditions, geography, company’s  willingness to balance the investment between acquisition vs. activity etc. Important thing to notice here is the  positive trend, and keep up with that momentum by balancing the investments between acquisition, activity and  monetization. Management should focus on continuous improvement of this metric through ‘product innovation’  and ‘cashback rate to activity correlation’ analysis.    Further work on e-commerce market sizing for the target geography and cashback penetration can lead to an ideal  revenue per user metric in a fully established market. The market readiness is too early for such an analysis.  Recommended methodology to accomplish such a number:    (( )/( ))      |RPU = (|(|𝐸𝑀|∗|𝐶𝐵𝑃|)|/|(|𝐸𝑃|∗|𝐴𝑃|)|)|∗|𝑀𝑆𝐶|  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|      (( )/( ))        -  EP: Ecommerce using population (number)    -  RPU: Revenue per user    -  AP: Activity percent rate ( % )    -  EM: Ecommerce Market size of the geography in consideration ($ size)    -  MSC: Market share Capture goal for the company    -  CBP: Cashback affiliate marketing Penetration into  the ecommerce market ( % )    _Graph-6: FTBs vs. Activity of Existing Users_ _(_ Appendix-C _)_        -----      Expected Q4    Seasonality    ###### FTBs vs. Active Existing Users    6000000    5000000    4000000    3000000    2000000    1000000    Critical inflection point    where existing user activity    0    is more than the newly    Q2 2020 Q3 2020 Q4 2020 Q1 2021 Q2 2021    acquired users    FTBs Existing Active Users        Simple graphical analysis of **FTB activity vs. existing user activity** reveals that the company made a significant  transition in engaging existing users in Q1, 2021. This trend further re-iterates the healthy trend of increased  activity of the existing users, which will lead to a sustained growth and more ROI on the CAC.    _Graph-7: Trend of existing user activity_      |Percent of active existing registered users 40% 34% 33% 30% 24% 23% 22% 20% 10% 0% Q2 2020 Q3 2020 Q4 2020 Q1 2021 Q2 2021|Healthy QoQ increase post pandemic related slowdowns|  |---|---|          Further analysis of trend in activity of existing users reveals that there is a 55% increase in the activity rate of  existing users between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021. This is a very good indication but too high because of low activity  rate back in Q2 2020 due to COVID. But, the activity rate between Q1 2021 and Q2 2021 is still showing a positive  change, bringing more confidence in the healthy trend of user engagement.    **LTV analysis**    Methodology used for LTV contribution calculation for an acquired user:    Keyoor Consulting, proprietary – Do not publish or distribute      |LTVc = (|𝑁 𝐺𝑀∗𝐹𝑌𝑅∑ (1 + 𝑟)𝑘−1(1 + 𝑅)𝑘−1 𝑘=1|) − 𝐶𝐴𝐶|  |---|---|---|    |(|1|+|𝑟)|𝑘−1|(|1|+|𝑅|)|𝑘−1|  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|      ( ∑( ) ( )    )    𝑘1      |𝑘|=|1|  |---|---|---|      -  LTVc = Lifetime Value contribution over N measuring periods    -  FYR = First Year/Period Revenue (FYR = GMV*average commission rate)    -  GM = Gross Margin    -  N = # of periods in consideration    -  r = average commerce activity degradation value for the cohorts in the measured period (negative percentage)    -  R = average increase in spend per active cohort for the measured period (positive percentage, ideally)    -  CAC = Onetime customer acquisition cost    Values for these business metrics are detailed in _Appendix-C_ .    __
