Q: What is the name of the civilisation that is also referred to as the Harappan culture, and is characterized by distinctive artifacts such as seals, beads, weights, stone blades, and baked bricks, found in areas such as Afghanistan, Jammu, Baluchistan, and Gujarat, and is dated between c. 2600 and 1900 BCE?
A: The Indus Valley Civilisation, also known as the Harappan culture.

Made of a stone called steatite, seals like this one often contain animal motifs and signs from a script that remains undeciphered. Yet we know a great deal about the lives of the people who lived in the region from what they left behind – their houses, pots, ornaments, tools and seals – in other words, from archaeological evidence. Let us see what we know about the Harappan civilisation, and how we know about it. We will explore how archaeological material is interpreted and how interpretations sometimes change. Of course, there Fig. 1.1 A Harappan seal are some aspects of the civilisation that are as yet unknown and may even remain so.||  |||  |Terms, places, times The Indus valley civilisation is also called the Harappan culture. Archaeologists use the term “culture” for a group of objects, distinctive in style, that are usually found together within a specific geographical area and period of time. In the case of the Harappan culture, these distinctive objects include seals, beads, weights, stone blades (Fig. 1.2) and even baked bricks. These objects were found from areas as far apart as Afghanistan, Jammu, Baluchistan (Pakistan) and Gujarat (Map 1). Named after Harappa, the first site where this unique culture was discovered (p. 6), the civilisation is dated between c. 2600 and 1900 BCE. There were earlier and later cultures, often called Early Harappan and Late Harappan, in the same area. The Harappan civilisation is sometimes called the Mature Harappan culture to distinguish it from these cultures.||      _Fig. 1.2_  _Beads, weights, blades_    Rationalised 2023-24        -----      ######  ###### T HEMES  IN I NDIAN H ISTORY ###### 2

Q: What was the approximate time period of the Mature Harappan civilisation?
A: The Mature Harappan civilisation occurred around 239 BCE to 136 CE, based on the dating system used in the book.

Q: What is the evidence used by archaeologists to reconstruct dietary practices in the Indus Valley Civilization?
A: The evidence used by archaeologists to reconstruct dietary practices in the Indus Valley Civilization includes the presence of various grains such as wheat, barley, lentil, chickpea, and sesame, as well as animal bones found at Harappan sites, which indicate that cattle, sheep, goat, buffalo, and pig were domesticated. Additionally, the presence of fish and owl bones suggests that the Harappans may have consumed fish and other wild animals. The discovery of saddle querns, which were likely used for grinding grains, and the presence of vessels for mixing, blending, and cooking, also provide insight into the processing and preparation of food in the Indus Valley Civilization.

Q: What was the primary material used for constructing buildings in Mohenjodaro's Citadel and Lower Town?
A: The primary material used for constructing buildings in Mohenjodaro's Citadel and Lower Town was mud brick, with buildings in the Citadel constructed on mud brick platforms and the Lower Town featuring buildings built on platforms that served as foundations. The use of standardized bricks, whether sun-dried or baked, was also prevalent across all Harappan settlements.

Mohenjodaro  ##### A Planned Urban Centre    Perhaps the most unique feature of the Harappan  civilisation was the development of urban centres.  Let us look at one such centre, Mohenjodaro,  more closely. Although Mohenjodaro is the most _Fig. 1.7_      |well-known site, the first site to be discovered was Harappa.

As early as 1875,  Alexander Cunningham, the  first Director-General of the  Archaeological Survey of  India (ASI), often called the  father of Indian archaeology,  noted that the amount  of brick taken from the  ancient site was  enough  to lay bricks for “about  100 miles” of the railway  line between L ahore and  Multan. Thus, many of the  ancient structures at the site  were damaged. In contrast,  Mohenjodaro was far better  preserved.    lower. Archaeologists designate these as the Citadel  and the Lower Town respectively. The Citadel owes  its height to the fact that buildings were constructed  on mud brick platforms. It was walled, which  meant that it was physically separated from the  Lower Town.  The Lower Town was also walled. Several buildings  were built on platforms, which served as foundations.  It has been calculated that if one labourer moved  roughly a cubic metre of earth daily, just to put the  foundations in place it would have required four  million person-days, in other words, mobilising  labour on a very large scale.  Consider something else. Once the platforms were  in place, all building activity within the city was  restricted to a fixed area on the platforms. So it  seems that the settlement was first planned and  then implemented accordingly. Other signs of  planning include bricks, which, whether sun-dried  or baked, were of a standardised ratio, where the  length and breadth were four times and twice the  height respectively. Such bricks were used at all  Harappan settlements.

Q: What was the purpose of the drainage system in the Harappan cities, and how was it designed?
A: The purpose of the drainage system in the Harappan cities was to provide a clean and hygienic environment for the residents. The system was designed with carefully planned drainage channels that were made of bricks set in mortar and covered with loose bricks that could be removed for cleaning. The drains were connected to the street channels, and every house had its own bathroom and drainage system that was connected to the street drains. The main channels were provided with sumps for cleaning, and little heaps of material, mostly sand, have frequently been found lying alongside drainage channels, which shows that the debris was not always carted away when the drain was cleared. The drainage system was not unique to the larger cities, but was also found in smaller settlements, and it is considered one of the most distinctive features of Harappan cities.
Context: _Fig. 1.8_  _A drain in Mohenjodaro_  Notice the huge opening of the  drain.    3.1 Laying out drains  One of the most distinctive features of Harappan  cities was the carefully planned drainage system. If  you look at the plan of the Lower Town you will notice  that roads and streets were laid out along an  approximate “grid” pattern, intersecting at right  angles. It seems that streets with drains were laid  out first and then houses built along them. If  domestic waste water had to flow into the street  drains, every house needed to have at least one wall  along a street.    ##### Citadels    While most Harappan settlements have a small high  western part and a larger lower eastern section, there  are variations. At sites such as Dholavira and Lothal  (Gujarat), the entire settlement was fortified, and  sections within the town were also separated by walls.  The Citadel within Lothal was not walled off, but was  built at a height.
