  Q: What is the evidence used by archaeologists to reconstruct dietary practices in the Indus Valley Civilization?
A: The evidence used by archaeologists to reconstruct dietary practices in the Indus Valley Civilization includes the presence of various grains such as wheat, barley, lentil, chickpea, and sesame, as well as animal bones found at Harappan sites, which indicate that cattle, sheep, goat, buffalo, and pig were domesticated. Additionally, the presence of fish and owl bones suggests that the Harappans may have consumed fish and other wild animals. The discovery of saddle querns, which were likely used for grinding grains, and the presence of vessels for mixing, blending, and cooking, also provide insight into the processing and preparation of food in the Indus Valley Civilization.

  Q: What was the purpose of the drainage system in the Harappan cities, and how was it designed?

A: The purpose of the drainage system in the Harappan cities was to provide a clean and hygienic environment for the residents. The system was designed with carefully planned drainage channels that were made of bricks set in mortar and covered with loose bricks that could be removed for cleaning. The drains were connected to the street channels, and every house had its own bathroom and drainage system that was connected to the street drains. The main channels were provided with sumps for cleaning, and little heaps of material, mostly sand, have frequently been found lying alongside drainage channels, which shows that the debris was not always carted away when the drain was cleared. The drainage system was not unique to the larger cities, but was also found in smaller settlements, and it is considered one of the most distinctive features of Harappan cities.
