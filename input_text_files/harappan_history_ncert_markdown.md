|The Harappan seal (Fig.1.1) is possibly the most distinctive artefact of the Harappan or Indus valley civilisation. Made of a stone called steatite, seals like this one often contain animal motifs and signs from a script that remains undeciphered. Yet we know a great deal about the lives of the people who lived in the region from what they left behind – their houses, pots, ornaments, tools and seals – in other words, from archaeological evidence. Let us see what we know about the Harappan civilisation, and how we know about it. We will explore how archaeological material is interpreted and how interpretations sometimes change. Of course, there Fig. 1.1 A Harappan seal are some aspects of the civilisation that are as yet unknown and may even remain so.||
|||
|Terms, places, times The Indus valley civilisation is also called the Harappan culture. Archaeologists use the term “culture” for a group of objects, distinctive in style, that are usually found together within a specific geographical area and period of time. In the case of the Harappan culture, these distinctive objects include seals, beads, weights, stone blades (Fig. 1.2) and even baked bricks. These objects were found from areas as far apart as Afghanistan, Jammu, Baluchistan (Pakistan) and Gujarat (Map 1). Named after Harappa, the first site where this unique culture was discovered (p. 6), the civilisation is dated between c. 2600 and 1900 BCE. There were earlier and later cultures, often called Early Harappan and Late Harappan, in the same area. The Harappan civilisation is sometimes called the Mature Harappan culture to distinguish it from these cultures.||

##### The plight of Harappa

Although Harappa was the
first site to be discovered, it
was badly destroyed by brick
robbers. As early as 1875,
Alexander Cunningham, the
first Director-General of the
Archaeological Survey of
India (ASI), often called the
father of Indian archaeology,
noted that the amount
of brick taken from the
ancient site was  enough
to lay bricks for “about
100 miles” of the railway
line between L ahore and
Multan. Thus, many of the
ancient structures at the site
were damaged. In contrast,
Mohenjodaro was far better
preserved.

lower. Archaeologists designate these as the Citadel
and the Lower Town respectively. The Citadel owes
its height to the fact that buildings were constructed
on mud brick platforms. It was walled, which
meant that it was physically separated from the
Lower Town.
The Lower Town was also walled. Several buildings
were built on platforms, which served as foundations.
It has been calculated that if one labourer moved
roughly a cubic metre of earth daily, just to put the
foundations in place it would have required four
million person-days, in other words, mobilising
labour on a very large scale.
Consider something else. Once the platforms were
in place, all building activity within the city was
restricted to a fixed area on the platforms. So it
seems that the settlement was first planned and
then implemented accordingly. Other signs of
planning include bricks, which, whether sun-dried
or baked, were of a standardised ratio, where the
length and breadth were four times and twice the
height respectively. Such bricks were used at all
Harappan settlements.

_Fig. 1.8_
_A drain in Mohenjodaro_
Notice the huge opening of the
drain.

3.1 Laying out drains
One of the most distinctive features of Harappan
cities was the carefully planned drainage system. If
you look at the plan of the Lower Town you will notice
that roads and streets were laid out along an
approximate “grid” pattern, intersecting at right
angles. It seems that streets with drains were laid
out first and then houses built along them. If
domestic waste water had to flow into the street
drains, every house needed to have at least one wall
along a street.

##### Citadels

While most Harappan settlements have a small high
western part and a larger lower eastern section, there
are variations. At sites such as Dholavira and Lothal
(Gujarat), the entire settlement was fortified, and
sections within the town were also separated by walls.
The Citadel within Lothal was not walled off, but was
built at a height.

_Plan of the Citadel_

3.3 The Citadel
It is on the Citadel that we
find evidence of structures
that were probably used for
special public purposes.
These include the warehouse
– a massive structure of
which the lower brick
portions remain, while the
upper portions, probably
of wood, decayed long
ago – and the Great Bath.
The Great Bath was a
large rectangular tank in a
courtyard surrounded by a
corridor on all four sides.
There were two flights of
steps on the north and
south leading into the tank,
which was made watertight
by setting bricks on edge
and using a mortar of
gypsum. There were rooms
on three sides, in one of
which was a large well.
Water from the tank flowed
into a huge drain. Across  a
lane to the north lay a
smaller building with
eight bathrooms, four on
each side of a corridor,
with drains from each
bathroom connecting to a
drain that ran along the
corridor. The uniqueness of
the structure, as well as
the _context_ in which it
was found (the Citadel,
with several distinctive
buildings), has led scholars
to suggest that it was meant for some kind of a special
ritual bath.

#### 4. Tracking Social Differences

_Fig. 1.11_
_A copper mirror_

4.1 Burials
Archaeologists generally use certain strategies to
find out whether there were social or economic
differences amongst people living within a particular
culture. These include studying burials. You are
probably familiar with the massive pyramids of
Egypt, some of which were contemporaneous with
the Harappan civilisation. Many of these pyramids
were royal burials, where enormous quantities of
wealth was buried.
At burials in Harappan sites the dead were
generally laid in pits. Sometimes, there were
differences in the way the burial pit was made – in
some instances, the hollowed-out spaces were lined
with bricks. Could these variations be an indication
of social differences? We are not sure.
Some graves contain pottery and ornaments,
perhaps indicating a belief that these could be used
in the afterlife. Jewellery has been found in burials
of both men and women. In fact, in the excavations
at the cemetery in Harappa in the mid-1980s, an
ornament consisting of three shell rings, a jasper
(a kind of semi-precious stone) bead and hundreds
of micro beads was found near the skull of a male.
In some instances the dead were buried with copper
mirrors. But on the whole, it appears that the
Harappans did not believe in burying precious things
with the dead.

_Fig. 1.12_
_A faience pot_

4.2 Looking for “luxuries”
Another strategy to identify social differences is to
study artefacts, which archaeologists broadly
classify as utilitarian and luxuries. The first category
includes objects of daily use made fairly easily out
of ordinary materials such as stone or clay. These
include querns, pottery, needles, flesh-rubbers (body
scrubbers), etc., and are usually found distributed
throughout settlements. Archaeologists assume
objects were luxuries if they are rare or made from
costly, non-local materials or with complicated
technologies. Thus, little pots of faience (a material
made of ground sand or silica mixed with colour
and a gum and then fired) were probably considered
precious because they were difficult to make.
The situation becomes more complicated
when we find what seem to be articles of daily

######  ###### T HEMES  IN I NDIAN H ISTORY ###### 12

Sometimes, larger waste pieces were used up to
make smaller objects, but minuscule bits were
usually left in the work area. These traces suggest
that apart from small, specialised centres, craft
production was also undertaken in large cities such
as Mohenjodaro and Harappa.

#### 6. Strategies for Procuring
#### Materials

As is obvious, a variety of materials was used for
craft production. While some such as clay were
locally available, many such as stone, timber and
metal had to be procured from outside the alluvial
plain. Terracotta toy models of bullock carts suggest
that this was one important means of transporting
goods and people across land routes. Riverine routes
along the Indus and its tributaries, as well as coastal
routes were also probably used.

6.1 Materials from the subcontinent and beyond

_Fig.1.16_
_Copper and bronze vessels_

The Harappans procured materials for craft
production in various ways. For instance, they
established settlements such as Nageshwar and
Balakot in areas where shell was available. Other
such sites were Shortughai, in far-off Afghanistan,
near the best source of lapis lazuli, a blue stone
that was apparently very highly valued, and Lothal
which was near sources of carnelian (from Bharuch
in Gujarat), steatite (from south Rajasthan and north
Gujarat) and metal (from Rajasthan).
Another strategy for procuring raw materials may
have been to send expeditions to areas such as the
Khetri region of Rajasthan (for copper) and south
India (for gold). These expeditions established
communication with local communities. Occasional
finds of Harappan artefacts such as steatite micro
beads in these areas are indications of such contact.
There is evidence in the Khetri area for what
archaeologists call the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura culture,
with its distinctive non-Harappan pottery and
an unusual wealth of copper objects. It is possible
that the inhabitants of this region supplied copper
to the Harappans.

lower denominations of weights were binary (1, 2, 4,

denominations followed the decimal system. The
smaller weights were probably used for weighing
jewellery and beads. Metal scale-pans have also
been found.

#### 8. Ancient Authority
There are indications of complex decisions being
taken and implemented in Harappan society. Take
for instance, the extraordinary uniformity of
Harappan artefacts as evident in pottery (Fig. 1.14),
seals, weights and bricks. Notably, bricks, though
obviously not produced in any single centre, were of
a uniform ratio throughout the region, from Jammu
to Gujarat. We have also seen that settlements were
strategically set up in specific locations for various
reasons. Besides, labour was mobilised for making
bricks and for the construction of massive walls
and platforms.
Who organised these activities?

8.1 Palaces and kings

_Fig. 1.23_
_A “priest-king”_

##### Ü Discuss...
Could everybody in Harappan
society have been equal?

If we look for a centre of power or for depictions of
people in power, archaeological records provide no
immediate answers. A large building found at
Mohenjodaro was labelled as a palace by
archaeologists but no spectacular finds were
associated with it. A stone statue was labelled and
continues to be known as the “priest-king”. This is
because archaeologists were familiar with
Mesopotamian history and its “priest-kings” and have
found parallels in the Indus region. But as we will
see (p.23), the ritual practices of the Harappan
civilisation are not well understood yet nor are there
any means of knowing whether those who performed
them also held political power.
Some archaeologists are of the opinion that
Harappan society had no rulers, and that everybody
enjoyed equal status. Others feel there was no single
ruler but several, that Mohenjodaro had a separate
ruler, Harappa another, and so forth. Yet others
argue that there was a single state, given the
similarity in artefacts, the evidence for planned
settlements, the standardised ratio of brick size, and
the establishment of settlements near sources of raw

Sixteen skeletons of people with the ornaments that they were wearing when they
died were found from the same part of Mohenjodaro in 1925.

Much later, in 1947, R.E.M. Wheeler, then Director-General of the ASI, tried to
correlate this archaeological evidence with that of the Rigveda, the earliest known
text in the subcontinent. He wrote:

The Rigveda mentions pur , meaning rampart, fort or stronghold. Indra, the Aryan
war-god is called puramdara , the fort-destroyer.
Where are – or were – these citadels? It has in the past been supposed that they
were mythical … The recent excavation of Harappa may be thought to have
changed the picture. Here we have a highly evolved civilisation of essentially non-
Aryan type, now known to have employed massive fortifications … What destroyed
this firmly settled civilisation? Climatic, economic or political deterioration may
have weakened it, but its ultimate extinction is more likely to have been completed
by deliberate and large-scale destruction. It may be no mere chance that at a late
period of Mohenjodaro men, women, and children, appear to have been
massacred there. On circumstantial evidence, Indra stands accused.

F ROM R.E.M. W HEELER , “Harappa 1946”, Ancient India, 1947.

In the 1960s, the evidence of a massacre in Mohenjodaro was questioned by an
archaeologist named George Dales. He demonstrated that the skeletons found at the
site did not belong to the same period:

Whereas a couple of them definitely seem to indicate a slaughter, … the bulk of
the bones were found in contexts suggesting burials of the sloppiest and most
irreverent nature. There is no destruction level covering the latest period of the
city, no sign of extensive burning, no bodies of warriors clad in armour and
surrounded by the weapons of war. The citadel, the only fortified part of the city,
yielded no evidence of a final defence.

#### 10. Discovering the Harappan
#### Civilisation

So far, we have examined facets of the Harappan
civilisation in the context of how archaeologists
have used evidence from material remains to
piece together parts of a fascinating history. However,
there is another story as well – about how
archaeologists “discovered” the civilisation.
When Harappan cities fell into ruin, people
gradually forgot all about them. When men and
women began living in the area millennia later, they
did not know what to make of the strange artefacts
that occasionally surfaced, washed by floods or
exposed by soil erosion, or turned up while ploughing
a field, or digging for treasure.

_Fig. 1.24_
_Cunningham’s sketch of the first-_
_known seal from Harappa_

10.1 Cunningham’s confusion
When Cunningham, the first Director-General of the
ASI, began archaeological excavations in the mid-
nineteenth century, archaeologists preferred to use
the written word (texts and inscriptions) as a guide
to investigations. In fact, Cunningham’s main
interest was in the archaeology of the Early Historic
( _c_ . sixth century BCE -fourth century CE ) and later
periods. He used the accounts left by Chinese
Buddhist pilgrims who had visited the subcontinent
between the fourth and seventh centuries CE to locate
early settlements. Cunningham also collected,
documented and translated inscriptions found during
his surveys. When he excavated sites he tended to
recover artefacts that he thought had cultural value.
A site like Harappa, which was not part of the
itinerary of the Chinese pilgrims and was not known
as an Early Historic city, did not fit very neatly within
his framework of investigation. So, although
Harappan artefacts were found fairly often during
the nineteenth century and some of these reached
Cunningham, he did not realise how old these were.
A Harappan seal was given to Cunningham by an
Englishman. He noted the object, but unsuccessfully
tried to place it within the time-frame with which
he was familiar. This was because he, like many
others, thought that Indian history began with the
first cities in the Ganga valley (see Chapter 2). Given
his specific focus, it is not surprising that he missed
the significance of Harappa.

It was then that their significance began to be realised. Another archaeologist, Rakhal Das Banerji found similar seals at Mohenjodaro, leading to the conjecture that these sites were part of a single archaeological culture. Based on these finds, in 1924, John Marshall, Director-General of the ASI, announced the discovery of a new civilisation in the Indus valley to the world. As S.N. Roy noted in The Story of Indian Archaeology, “Marshall left India three thousand years older than he had found her.” This was because similar, till-then-unidentified seals were found at excavations at Mesopotamian sites. It was then that the world knew not only of a new civilisation, but also of one contemporaneous with Mesopotamia. In fact, John Marshall’s stint as Director-General of the ASI marked a major change in Indian archaeology. He was the first professional archaeologist to work in India, and brought his experience of working in Greece and Crete to the field. More importantly, though like Cunningham he too was interested in spectacular finds, he was equally keen to look for patterns of everyday life.

#### 1 #### 1. Problems of Piecing Together
#### the Past

As we have seen, it is not the Harappan script that
helps in understanding the ancient civilisation. Rather,
it is material evidence that allows archaeologists to
better reconstruct Harappan life. This material could
be pottery, tools, ornaments, household objects, etc.
Organic materials such as cloth, leather, wood and
reeds generally decompose, especially in tropical
regions. What survive are stone, burnt clay (or
terracotta), metal, etc.
It is also important to remember that only broken
or useless objects would have been thrown away.
Other things would probably have been recycled.
Consequently, valuable artefacts that are found
intact were either lost in the past or hoarded and
never retrieved. In other words, such finds are
accidental rather than typical.

11.1 Classifying finds
Recovering artefacts is just the beginning of the
archaeological enterprise. Archaeologists then
classify their finds. One simple principle of
classification is in terms of material, such as stone,
clay, metal, bone, ivory, etc. The second, and more
complicated, is in terms of function: archaeologists
have to decide whether, for instance, an artefact is
a tool or an ornament, or both, or something meant
for ritual use.
An understanding of the function of an artefact is
often shaped by its resemblance with present-day
things – beads, querns, stone blades and pots are
obvious examples. Archaeologists also try to identify
the function of an artefact by investigating the
context in which it was found: was it found in a
house, in a drain, in a grave, in a kiln?
Sometimes, archaeologists have to take recourse
to indirect evidence. For instance, though there are
traces of cotton at some Harappan sites, to find out
about clothing we have to depend on indirect
evidence including depictions in sculpture.
Archaeologists have to develop frames of reference.
We have seen that the first Harappan seal that was
found could not be understood till archaeologists had
a context in which to place it – both in terms of the
cultural sequence in which it was found, and in
terms of a comparison with finds in Mesopotamia.

A _linga_ is a polished stone
that is worshipped as a
symbol of Shiva.

11.2 Problems of interpretation
The problems of archaeological interpretation are
perhaps most evident in attempts to reconstruct
religious practices. Early archaeologists thought that
certain objects which seemed unusual or unfamiliar
may have had a religious significance. These included
terracotta figurines of women, heavily jewelled, some
with elaborate head-dresses. These were regarded
as mother goddesses. Rare stone statuary of men in
an almost standardised posture, seated with one
hand on the knee – such as the “priest-king” – was
also similarly classified. In other instances,
structures have been assigned ritual significance.
These include the Great Bath and fire altars found
at Kalibangan and Lothal.
Attempts have also been made to reconstruct
religious beliefs and practices by examining seals,
some of which seem to depict ritual scenes. Others,
with plant motifs, are thought to indicate nature
worship. Some animals – such as the one-horned
animal, often called the “unicorn” – depicted on seals
seem to be mythical, composite creatures. In some
seals, a figure shown seated cross-legged in a “yogic”
posture, sometimes surrounded by animals, has
been regarded as a depiction of “proto-Shiva”, that
is, an early form of one of the major deities of
Hinduism. Besides, conical stone objects have been
classified as _lingas_ .
Many reconstructions of Harappan religion are
made on the assumption that later traditions provide
parallels with earlier ones. This is because
archaeologists often move from the known to the
unknown, that is, from the present to the past. While
this is plausible in the case of stone querns and
pots, it becomes more speculative when we extend
it to “religious” symbols.
Let us look, for instance, at the “proto-Shiva” seals.
The earliest religious text, the _Rigveda_ (compiled _c_ .
1500-1000 BCE ) mentions a god named Rudra, which
is a name used for Shiva in later Puranic traditions
(in the first millennium CE ; see also Chapter 4).
However, unlike Shiva, Rudra in the _Rigveda_ is
neither depicted as Pashupati (lord of animals in
general and cattle in particular), nor as a yogi _._ In
other words, this depiction does not match the
description of Rudra in the _Rigveda_ . Is this, then,
possibly a shaman as some scholars have suggested?
