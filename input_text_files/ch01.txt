######## Activity ______________ 1.1

- Take a 100 mL beaker.

- Fill half the beaker with water and
mark the level of water.

- Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help
of a glass rod.

- Observe any change in water level.

- What do you think has happened to
the salt?

- Where does it disappear?

- Does the level of water change?
In order to answer these questions we
need to use the idea that matter is made up
of particles. What was there in the spoon,  salt
or sugar, has now spread throughout  water.
This is  illustrated in Fig. 1.1.

**_Fig. 1.1:_** _When we dissolve salt in water, the particles_
_of salt get into the spaces between particles_
_of water._

As we look at our surroundings, we see a large
variety of things with different shapes, sizes
and textures. Everything in this universe is
made up of material which scientists have
named “matter”. The air we breathe, the food
we eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and
animals, even a small drop of water or a
particle of sand — every thing is matter. We
can also see as we look around that all the
things mentioned above occupy space and
have mass. In other words, they have both
mass* and volume**.
Since early times, human beings have
been trying to understand their surroundings.
Early Indian philosophers classified matter in
the form of five basic elements — the _“Panch_
_Tatva_ ” — air, earth, fire, sky and water.
According to them everything, living or non-
living, was made up of these five basic
elements. Ancient Greek philosophers had
arrived at a similar classification of matter.
Modern day scientists have evolved two
types of classification of matter based on their
physical properties and chemical nature.
In this chapter we shall learn about
matter based on its physical properties.
Chemical aspects of matter will be taken up
in subsequent chapters.

######## Activity ______________ 1.2

For a long time, two schools of thought prevailed
regarding the nature of matter. One school
believed matter to be continuous like a block
of wood, whereas, the other thought that matter
was made up of particles like sand. Let us
perform an activity to decide about the nature
of matter — is it continuous or particulate?

- Take 2–3 crystals of potassium
permanganate and dissolve them in
100 mL of water.

***** The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg).

****** The SI unit of volume is cubic metre (m 3 ). The common unit of measuring volume is
litre (L) such that 1L = 1 dm 3 , 1L = 1000 mL, 1 mL = 1 cm 3 .

applied, it breaks.
- The shape of each individual sugar or
salt crystal remains fixed, whether we
take it in our hand, put it in a plate or in
a jar.
- A sponge has minute holes, in which
air is trapped, when we press it, the air
is expelled out and we are able to
compress it.

Observe different types of matter around you.
What are its different states? We can see that
matter around us exists in three different
states– solid, liquid and gas. These states of
matter arise due to the variation in the
characteristics of the particles of matter.
Now, let us study about the properties of
these three states of matter in detail.

######## Activity _____________  1.9

######## Activity _____________1.10

- Collect the following articles — a pen,
a book, a needle and a piece of wooden
stick.

- Sketch the shape of the above articles
in your notebook by moving a pencil
around them.

- Collect the following:
(a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a
cold drink.
(b) containers of different shapes. Put
a 50 mL mark on these containers
using a measuring cylinder from
the laboratory.

- Do all these have a definite shape,
distinct boundaries and a fixed volume?

- What will happen if these liquids are
spilt on the floor?

- What happens if they are hammered,
pulled or dropped?

- Are these capable of diffusing into each
other?

- Measure 50 mL of any one liquid and
transfer it into different containers one
by one. Does the volume remain the
same?
<CHUNK_SEPARATOR>
- Try compressing them by applying
force. Are you able to compress them?

- Does the shape of the liquid remain the
same ?

- When you pour the liquid from one
container into another, does it flow
easily?

All the above are examples of solids. We
can observe that all these have a definite
shape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,
that is, have negligible compressibility. Solids
have a tendency to maintain their shape when
subjected to outside force. Solids may break
under force but it is difficult to change their
shape, so they are rigid.

Consider the following:

We observe that liquids have no fixed
shape but have a fixed volume. They take up
the shape of the container in which they are
kept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they
are not rigid but can be called fluid.
Refer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we
saw that solids and liquids can diffuse into
liquids. The gases from the atmosphere
diffuse and dissolve in water. These gases,
especially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are
essential for the survival of aquatic animals
and plants.
All living creatures need to breathe for
survival. The aquatic animals can breathe
under water due to the presence of dissolved
oxygen  in water. Thus, we may conclude that
solids, liquids and gases can diffuse into
liquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is

(a) What about a rubber band, can it
change its shape on stretching? Is it
a solid?
(b) What about sugar and salt? When

yet we are able to compress it. Why?
All the above are solids as:

fact that in the liquid state, particles move
freely and have greater space between each

The particles gain energy from your palm or

to feel cool.
After a hot sunny day, people sprinkle
water on the roof or open ground because
the large latent heat of vaporisation of water
helps to cool the hot surface.
Can you cite some more examples from
daily life where we can feel the effect of cooling

**Why should we wear cotton clothes in**
**summer?**
During summer, we perspire more
because of the mechanism of our body which
keeps us cool. We know that during
evaporation, the particles at the surface of
the liquid gain energy from the surroundings
or body surface and change into vapour. The
heat energy equal to the latent heat of
vaporisation is absorbed from the body
leaving the body cool. Cotton, being a good
absorber of water helps in absorbing the
sweat and exposing it to the atmosphere for
easy evaporation.
